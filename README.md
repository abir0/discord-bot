# Discord Bot: robot

This is discord bot, robot, I made with discord.py, youtube-dl and ffmpeg. This bot is deployed and hosted by [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com).

[Add robot into your discord server](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=839384987291746304&permissions=3191861185&scope=bot).
