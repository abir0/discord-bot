# Discord Bot

This is a discord bot I made with [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io), youtube-dl and ffmpeg. This bot is hosted in [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com).

You can add this bot into your discord server from [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=839384987291746304&permissions=3191861185&scope=bot).
